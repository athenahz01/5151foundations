Course repository for SYSEN 5151: Foundations of Systems Engineering at Cornell University

This repository contains starter materials and scaffolding for Foundations of Systems Engineering. Students will build end-to-end skills for modern systems development by completing exercises in four key areas, each located in a separate folder.

You may use R, Python, or another language/framework of your choosing. Lessons and starter code will be provided in R and/or Python.

# 🔍 1. Query a Database

Learn how to retrieve data from different types of sources:

Static databases (easy):

.csv, .xlsx, or Google Sheets.


Dynamic databases (moderate):

Google Sheets → SQLite → MySQL or SQL.



You'll write scripts that connect, retrieve, and clean the data for further use.


---

# 🤖 2. Query a Generative AI Model

Learn to interact with LLM APIs. Choose from:

Meta’s LLaMA (harder setup, free):

Open-source, but you'll need to configure models yourself.


OpenAI or Gemini APIs (easy setup, paid):

Students must pay per call — this is your textbook cost.

Requires a credit card.

Optionally, you can apply for discounted API credits via Cornell’s AI support program (we'll provide details).

# 🔌 3. Run a REST API

Connect your data and models through a local or hosted REST API:

Python → FastAPI

R → plumber


This is the bridge between your data logic and front-end or other systems.


---

# 💻 4. Show the Results in a Front-End App

You'll design a simple front-end interface to display or interact with results. Options include:

- R/Python → ShinyApps (easy, less performant)

- ‘Reporter’ static site (easiest)

- Command-line chatbot (mid-level, fast)

- ReactJS app (most work, most polish — good for public-facing projects)
